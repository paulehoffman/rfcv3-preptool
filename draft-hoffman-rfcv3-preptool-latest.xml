    <abstract>


<t>This short document describes some aspects of the “prep tool” that is expected
to be created when the new RFC v3 specification is deployed.
This draft is just a way to keep track of the ideas; it is not (currently)
expected to be published as an RFC.</t>

<!--
- if the schema doesn't adequately protect, error if both section and relative don't exist
- warn if derivedRemoteContent exists?
- error if <relref> contains both text and derivedRemoteContent
- fill in derivedLink on all <relref> elements
- fill in derivedRemoteContent on <relref> elements that do not contain text
- try to fetch the derived URI if it knows the protocol scheme (warning if it doesn't), and warn (or error?) if the doc doesn't exist.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>As a part of the new HTML format work, the RFC Editor has decided that the XML2RFCv3 vocabulary
<xref target="I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc"/> will be canonical, in the sense that it is the data that is blessed by the process as
the actual RFC. See <xref target="RFC6949"/> for more detail on this.</t>

<t>Most people will read other formats, such as HTML, PDF, ASCII text, or other formats of the future, however. 
In order to ensure each of these format is as similar as possible to one another as well as the canonical XML,
there is a desire for the translation from XML into the other formats will be straightforward syntactic
translation. To make that happen, a good amount of data will need to be in the XML format that is notthere today.
That data will be added by a program called the “prep tool”, which will often run as a part
of the xml2rfc process.</t>

<t>This draft specifies the steps that the prep tool will have to take.
As changes to <xref target="I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc"/> are made, this document will be updated.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="v3-prep-tool-usage-scenarios" title="v3 Prep Tool Usage Scenarios">

<t>The prep tool will have (at least) two settings:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Internet-Draft preparation</t>
  <t>Canonical RFC preparation</t>
</list></t>

<t>There are only a few difference between these two settings. For example, the
boilerplate output will be different, as will the date output on the front page.</t>

<t>Note that this only describes what the IETF-sponsored prep tool does. Others
might create their own work-alike prep tools for their own formatting needs.
However, an output format developer does not not need to change the prep tool in
order to create their own formatter: they only need to be able to consume
prepared text.</t>

<t>This tool is described as if it is a separate tool so that we can reason about
its architectural properties. In actual implementation, it might be a part of a
larger suite of functionality.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="internet-draft-submission" title="Internet-Draft Submission">

<t>When the IETF draft submission tool accepts v3 XML as an input format, the
submission tool runs the submitted file through the prep tool. If the tool finds
no errors, it keeps two XML files: the submitted file and the prepped file.</t>

<t>The prepped file provides a record of what a submitter was attesting to at the time of submission.
It represents a self-contained record of what any external references
resolved to at the time of submission.</t>

<t>The prepped file is used by the IETF
formatters to create outputs such as HTML, PDF, and text (or the tools act in a
way indistinguishable from this). The message sent out by the draft submission
tool includes a link to the original XML as well as the other outputs, including
the prepped XML.</t>

<t>The prepped XML can be used by tools not yet developed to output new formats
that have as similar output as possible to the current IETF formatters. For
example, if the IETF creates a .mobi output renderer later, it can run that renderer on
all of the prepped XML that has been saved, ensuring that the content of included
external references and all of the part numbers and boilerplate will be the same
as what was produced by the previous IETF formatters at the time the document
was first uploaded.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="canonical-rfc-preparation" title="Canonical RFC Preparation">

<t>During AUTH48, the RPC will run the prep tool in canonical RFC preparation mode
and make the results available to the authors so they can see what the final
output might look like. When the document is done with AUTH48 review, the RPC
runs the prep tool in canonical RFC preparation mode one last time, locks down
the canonicalized XML, runs the formatters for the non-canonical output, and
publishes all of those. It is probably a good idea for the RPC to keep a copy of
the input XML file from the various steps of the RFC production process.</t>

<t>Similarly to I-D’s, the prepped XML can be used later to re-render the output
formats, or to generate new formats.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="what-the-v3-prep-tool-does" title="What the v3 Prep Tool Does">

<t>The steps listed here are in order of processing.
In all cases where the prep tool would “add” an attribute or element, if that attribute or element already
exists, the prep tool will check that the attribute or element is correct.
If the value is incorrect, the prep tool will warn with the old and new values, then replace the incorrect value with the new value.</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>Process all &lt;x:include&gt; elements. Note: &lt;x:include&gt;d XML may include more
&lt;x:include&gt;s (with relative URLs rooted at the xml:base).
The tool must be configurable with a limit on the depth of recursion.</t>
  <t>If in RFC production mode:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Remove comments.</t>
      <t>Remove processing instructions.</t>
      <t>Remove DTD references.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Add the <xref target="RFC5741"/> boilerplate text with current values.
However, if different boilerplate text already exists in the input, produce a warning
that says that other tools, specifically the draft submission tool, will treat that condition as an error.
The application will use the “ipr”, “category”, “submission”, and “consensus” attributes of the &lt;rfc&gt; element
to determine which <xref target="RFC5741"/> boilerplate to include, as described in Appendix A of <xref target="I-D.hoffman-xml2rfc"/>.</t>
  <t>Fill in the “prepTime” attribute of &lt;rfc&gt; with the current datetime.</t>
  <t>If in I-D mode, fill in “expiresDate” attribute of &lt;rfc&gt;.</t>
  <t>Fill in any default values for attributes on elements, except “keepWithNext” and
“keepWithPrevious” of &lt;t&gt;, and “toc” of &lt;section&gt;.</t>
  <t>If the &lt;workgroup&gt; content doesn’t end with “Group”, issue a warning.</t>
  <t>Add a “slugifiedName” attribute to each &lt;name&gt; element that does not contain one;
replace the attribute if it contains a value that begins with “n-“.</t>
  <t>Add “pn” attributes for all parts.  Parts are:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>&lt;section&gt;: pn=’s-1.4.2’</t>
      <t>&lt;abstract&gt;: pn=’s-abstract’</t>
      <t>&lt;note&gt;: pn=’s-note-[counter]’</t>
      <t>&lt;table&gt;: pn=’t-3’</t>
      <t>&lt;figure&gt;: pn=’f-4’</t>
      <t>&lt;artwork&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;,
 &lt;li&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;references&gt;, &lt;sourcecode&gt;, &lt;t&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;:
 pn=’p-[section]-[counter]’</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Add a “start” attribute to every &lt;ol&gt; element containing a group that doesn’t already have a start.</t>
  <t>Sort the references, if “sortRefs” of &lt;rfc&gt; is true.</t>
  <t>Resolve all &lt;xref&gt; elements. Ensure that each target is valid.
Invent text for each element that doesn’t have it.
(More steps will be added here when the community has agreement on *ref.)</t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has both a “src” attribute and there is any existing content, give an error.</t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has a “src” attribute with no scheme is specified,
treat the scheme as “file:” in a path relative to the file being processed.</t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has a “src” attribute with a “file:” scheme,
and if processing the URL would cause the processor to retrieve a file that is not in the same directory,
or a subdirectory, as the file being processed, give an error.</t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has a “src” attribute URI scheme that is not “data:”, “file:”, “http:”, or “https:”, give an error.</t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has type=’svg’ and there is a “src” attribute,
the data needs to be moved into the content of the &lt;artwork&gt; element.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “data:”, fill the content of the &lt;artwork&gt; element with that data
 and remove the “src” attribute.</t>
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “file:”, “http:”, or “https:”, fill the content of the &lt;artwork&gt; element with the
 resolved text from the URI in the “src” attribute.
 Add an “xml:base” attribute with the value of the URI and remove the “src” attribute.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has type=’svg’, check the SVG schema of the resulting content
against the profile in <xref target="I-D.brownlee-svg-rfc"/>. Give an error (?) if it does not pass
the check.</t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element has type=’binary-art’, the data needs to be in a “src” attribute with a URI scheme of “data:”.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the element has content, give an error.</t>
      <t>If in RFC production mode, give an error.</t>
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “http:” or “https:”, resolve the URL. Replace the “src” attribute with a “data:” URI,
 add an “xml:base” attribute with the value of the URI, and remove the “src” attribute. </t>
    </list></t>
  <t>If an &lt;artwork&gt; element does not have type=’svg’ or type=’binary-art’ and there is a “src” attribute,
the data needs to be moved into the content of the &lt;artwork&gt; element. Note that this step assumes that all
of the preferred types other than “binary-art” are text.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “data:”, fill the content of the &lt;artwork&gt; element with that data
 and remove the “src” attribute.</t>
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “file:”, “http:”, or “https:”, fill the content of the &lt;artwork&gt; element with the
 resolved text from the URI in the “src” attribute.
 Add an “xml:base” attribute with the value of the URI and remove the “src” attribute.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>If a &lt;sourcecode&gt; element has both a “src” attribute and there is any existing content, give an error.</t>
  <t>If a &lt;sourcecode&gt; element has a “src” attribute with no scheme is specified,
treat the scheme as “file:” in a path relative to the file being processed.</t>
  <t>If an &lt;sourcecode&gt; element has a “src” attribute with a “file:” scheme,
and if processing the URL would cause the processor to retrieve a file that is not in the same directory,
or a subdirectory, as the file being processed, give an error.</t>
  <t>If a &lt;sourcecode&gt; element has a “src” attribute URI scheme that is not “data:”, “file:”, “http:”, or “https:”, give an error.</t>
  <t>If a &lt;sourcecode&gt; element has a “src” attribute,
the data needs to be moved into the content of the &lt;sourcecode&gt; element.
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “data:”, fill the content of the &lt;sourcecode&gt; element with that data
 and remove the “src” attribute.</t>
      <t>If the “src” URI scheme is “file:”, “http:”, or “https:”, fill the content of the &lt;sourcecode&gt; element with the
 resolved text from the URI in the “src” attribute.
 Add an “xml:base” attribute with the value of the URI and remove the “src” attribute.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Add a &lt;link&gt; child element to &lt;rfc&gt; for the DOI, if in RFC production mode.</t>
  <t>Determine all the characters used in the document, and fill in “scripts” attribute for &lt;rfc&gt;.</t>
  <t>Ensure that the output has the “version” attribute of &lt;rfc&gt;, and that it is set to “3”.</t>
  <t>Pretty-format the XML output.  (Note: tools like <eref target="https://github.com/hildjj/dentin">https://github.com/hildjj/dentin</eref> do an adequate job.)</t>
  <t>If in RFC production mode, ensure that the result is in full compliance to v3 schema, without any deprecated
elements or attributes, and give an error if any issues are found.</t>
